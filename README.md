# shiny_slides
Developed with inspiration from and in collaboration with Julia Falvey, this demo R Shiny application takes in user supplied MS Powerpoint templates and data, cleans the data, and creates a visualization which the user can preview in the app or generate into a MS Powerpoint slide with just a few clicks. More examples to come, WIP!
